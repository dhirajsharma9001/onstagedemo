<h2>5 ways Indian Weddings have evolved</h2>



<p></p>



<p>Indian wedding traditions are popularly known for their notable and unique characteristics which include a myriad of wedding traditions, ceremonies and festivities. While they are always synonymous with fun moments and exciting celebrations, but a lot has evolved owing to the changing tastes, social mores, exposure and lifestyle choices of many Indian couples. Cool wedding customs and distinct ideas are fast replacing the older wedding traditions. A wedding can now be fully customised as per the tastes of the couple and their city of choice. An experienced <strong><a href="https://www.countrywidevents.in/wedding-planner.php">wedding event management company in Delhi</a></strong> can plan your dream wedding in unique and customized ways. Everything new is making Indian weddings all the more special. Here are 5 ways how Indian weddings are evolving and becoming more dynamic.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



<h3>Tradition and Rituals</h3>



<p><br><p>Traditions and rituals in the wedding are now evolving to suit the personal beliefs of couples. They are now taking time to understand these traditions rather than following these rituals blindly. Pre-wedding parties also known as sangeet are gaining popularity. The celebration consists of the bride’s and the groom’s family members getting together for song and dance. Unlike the times when wedding guests and relatives used to be pretty shy and reserved, it&#8217;s amazing to see everyone coming forward to shake a leg. Above all, the dance performances offers respite from all the taxing wedding preparations.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p>



<h3>Outfits</h3>



<p><br><p>Indian wedding outfits are unique and beautiful in their own essence. However, we have seen brides dressing up in a traditional way for decades but now they are&nbsp; getting more experimental with colours and textures to match their themes, or even their moods. They are not only focusing on the colour or designs of their outfit but also actively participate to decide about the cuts, the drape and the accessories that go with it.<br></p></p>



<p><br></p>



<h3>Wedding invitations</h3>



<p><br><p>The wedding invitation card plays a very important role in Indian weddings. It is meant to invite people to witness a very beautiful union, between two people and their respective families. The design and format of wedding invitations have undergone many changes and evolved over a period of time. Invites with bright Indian colours are a thing of the past, people are now opting for more subtle shades or floral invites. These days, wooden wedding cards are also being used to wow the guests. Wooden wedding invites are also becoming a trend for style conscious couples adding more value to the card.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p>



<h3>The Ambience and the Venue</h3>



<p><br><p>Over the years, Indian weddings have become a more lavish and grand affair. With decoration and menu more creative than ever, couples are focusing on creating a memorable experience for their guests. Flowers such as mogra, delphinium and especially roses today are an imperative part of Indian weddings setting the vibe and ambience. For grand and royal weddings, bright colored shades and extravagant flowers are being used to give an elegant and unbeatable look. Indian weddings are grand affairs with multiple rituals that are performed on days before and after the wedding. Traditional venues such as banquet and party halls are a passe now<strong>. </strong>People are now getting creative and opting unique venues such as a National park, a beach or even a nightclub! This results in a more relaxed and fun environment than a very conservative wedding setup. A <a href="https://www.countrywidevents.in">professional wedding event management company in Delhi</a> offers multi disciplinary services and can help you create the desired set up.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p>



<h3>Destination weddings</h3>



<p><br><p>Destination weddings are gaining popularity among young Indian couples. The charm and mystical beauty of a destination elevates the wedding celebrations to a new level making them unique and memorable. Big fat Indian weddings might have been a trend so far, but today’s couples are moving away from overcrowded wedding ceremonies. For people who like to thoroughly enjoy with their closest friends and family, huge wedding parties are not a great idea.&nbsp; It is the privacy and intimacy of a destination wedding that people have started appreciating. Be in on a breach, an exotic island or a regal castle, destination weddings are opulent minus the crowd. A destination wedding ensures that everyone involved receives due attention and enjoys to the fullest.&nbsp;<br></p></p>

           </div>
<br>
<p>No matter how much the wedding trends have changed and evolved, <strong>Indian weddings</strong> are always cooler and happening than any other wedding. With endless amount of fun and laughter all around, Indian wedding celebrations and ceremonies go on and on for a long time.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>A wedding means a reunion between two souls and two families. Often we seem to indulge ourselves in the overall preparation of the wedding in a way that we are left with no opportunity to enjoy those special moments which will never come back again. Proper planning for a wedding takes much more than we could ever think. Not only it is about the bride and groom, but also about satisfying the guests who are invited. <gwmw style="display:none;"></p>



<p>A destination wedding is a hot trend today. It allows everyone to indulge in the celebrations. Right from amazing cuisines to wines to exotic location, a destination wedding is a rustic, romantic affair. However, many of us think that it involves a lot of expenditure and may not be their cup of tea. But wait! A destination wedding has many perks over planning the wedding in your hometown. And most importantly, it can be done in a budget-friendly way as well. So count on the below positive points of a destination wedding when marriage is on your card. <gwmw style="display:none;"></p>



<p><strong>1. Leave the planning to the destination wedding planners: </strong>Planning a wedding yourself can be really stressful. When you opt for a destination wedding, you will get detailed assistance from destination <strong><a href="https://www.countrywidevents.in/"> wedding planners</a></strong> who will make it a cakewalk for you. Starting from choosing the venue to contacting the local vendors for supplying materials for the wedding, everything will be taken care of by them. There are many wedding packages made available by such destination wedding planners. They quote the price according to the chosen destination, tenure of stay, number of guests, menu, etc.</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Prepare a list of invitees who are close enough and enjoy your heart out:</strong> Wedding for many of us means inviting guests whom we hardly know. When you plan for a destination wedding, you can really cut short your invitee list as you are planning the wedding out of town. In this way, the entire wedding affair remains personal to close friends and family who mean a lot to you. The bride and the groom can spend quality time with each other and so will their closed ones in the beautiful location at their wedding.<br></p>



<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Capture moments that you will cherish for a lifetime: </strong> A destination wedding is all about a breath-taking location and picture-perfect moments. When you choose a perfect setup for your wedding, no wonder, the place is a mesmerizing one and gives an out of the world feeling. Make full utilization of the beautiful location and grab every opportunity to take amazing shots which you will treasure for a lifetime. To add to the fun, hire a <strong><a href="https://www.countrywidevents.in/wedding-planner.php">destination wedding planner</a></strong> who can make it an unforgettable and memorable event. </p>



<p><strong>4. Vacation with your loved ones in an exotic location:  </strong>This is your last vacation with all of your closest friends and family. Having a destination wedding is a unique way to be on vacation with all your loved ones at the same time. Not only do you celebrate your special day with them but would also have great fun in an exciting destination, with your favorite people by your side. <br></p>



<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Start your honeymoon right there:</strong> The best part of a destination wedding is that you can right away start your honeymoon in a picture-perfect location and there is no need to make separate travel plans after your wedding. The bride and groom will have endless opportunities to enjoy the mesmerizing location, and get full privacy to enjoy each other’s company.</p>



<p>So, these are the five reasons why you should choose a destination wedding over a traditional wedding. In addition to this, if you are a creative person, then let your creative juice flow. You will have enough space to show your creative side while you plan for your destination wedding.<br></p>
